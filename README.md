# Password-Generator
JavaScript password generator

A code refactor with a goal of adding functionality to the javascript. 
The end goal was to create a live page with a password generator. Designed to ask a user, through prompts, to select the parameters of their password. Once selected the javascript will generate a random password and display it for the user.
